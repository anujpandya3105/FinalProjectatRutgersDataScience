## Model the Rate of Uninsured people in the United States as a function of
## a) Poverty (Univariat Regression)
## b) Poverty and Unemployment (Multivariat Regression)

## Technologies Used:
### Python
### Pandas
### Matplotlib
### Scikit Learn
### Numpy
### Jupyter Notebook
### Sqlite
### MS-Excel
### Tableau

## Data for the project was sourced using APIs from the US Census Bureau and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
## Created a Linear and Random Forest Regression to establish the correlation between Poverty and Uninsurance and used matplotlib to draw ## scatter plots and histograms to visualize how the prediction relates to the actual data set.
